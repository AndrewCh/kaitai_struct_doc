= Kaitai Struct: Java notes
:source-highlighter: coderay

== Usage patterns

Parsing a structure directly from a local file:

[source,java]
----
AnExampleClass.fromFile("an_example.data")
----

Parsing a structure from a byte array (`byte[]`):

[source,java]
----
new AnExampleClass(new KaitaiStream(byteArray))
----

Note that parsing from non-seekable streams (i.e.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/FileInputStream.html[FileInputStream],
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/BufferedInputStream.html[BufferedInputStream],
etc) is not supported and probably won't be supported, as a lot of
parsing functionality in KS relies on seek support.

== Runtime library

Following most other runtimes example, everything revolves around two
basic classes:

* KaitaiStruct — a common superclass for all classes that represent user
types in KS. Java implementation is very limited and basically only
keeps `_io` member of type KaitaiStream and provides a getter for it.
* KaitaiStream — a useful abstraction of seekable input stream that can
be read with [[Kaitai Struct stream API]] (i.e. methods like
`readU4le()`. Internally, it uses either a
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/ByteArrayInputStream.html[ByteArrayInputStream]
or
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/RandomAccessFile.html[RandomAccessFile]
to read either a in-memory byte buffer or a local file.

== Naming

KS tries to follow mandatory and recommended Java practices as close as
possible.

Class names would be represented in upper camel case (i.e.
`an_example_class` => `AnExampleClass`).

All attributes and instance names use lower camel case (i.e.
`an_example_attribute` => `anExampleAttribute`).

== Types

All user types are mapped 1-to-1 to relevant Java classes. Nested types
are mapped to nested classes, i.e. for nested types like this:

[source,yaml]
----
meta:
  id: parent
# ...
types:
  child:
    # ...
    types:
      grandchild:
        # ...
----

one can expect to get the following class structure:

[source,java]
----
public class Parent extends KaitaiStruct {
    public static class Child extends KaitaiStruct {
        public static class GrandChild extends KaitaiStruct {
        }
    }
}    
----

Every generated class will have 3 constructors and a static factory
method (plus a private `_parse()` method that is invoked from all the
constructors to do actual parsing):

[source,java]
----
public AnExampleClass(KaitaiStream _io)
public AnExampleClass(KaitaiStream _io, KaitaiStruct _parent)
public AnExampleClass(KaitaiStream _io, KaitaiStruct _parent, AnExampleClass _root)
public static AnExampleClass fromFile(String fileName)
----

== Attributes

Attribute parsing is done in `_parse()` method which is typically
invoked from a constructor. All parsed attributes are stored as private
member variables.

For all attributes, a relevant getter method will be generated, so an
attribute can be accessed outside of class like
`classInstance.anExampleAttribute()`.

== Primitive type mapping

There are several things of note that influence mapping KS types to Java
types:

* There are no support for unsigned integer types in Java. In some cases
it's no big deal, but some use cases (for example, comparison or bit
shifts) may be severely hindered by that issue. KS tries to make up for
that fact by using larger signed types where that's possible and
reasonable to do. Where it's not possible (i.e. 64-bit unsigned integers
— `u8`), KS would use signed `long` type.
* Java has 2 types for every numeric type: "primitive" type (i.e. `int`)
and "reference" type (i.e. `Integer`) — the latter being a full-featured
object that can have `null` assigned to it and stored in collections.
It's not practical to use reference types everywhere, so KS makes use of
them only in the following situations:
* when data type is used as part of a collection
* when it's possible that a particular attribute / instance will be
unassigned (i.e. because of [[if|attribute description#if]] expression)
— `null` will be returned in this case

The overall primitive type mapping goes as follows:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|================================================
|`type` |Java primitive type |Java reference type
|no type |byte[] |byte[]
|`u1` |int |Integer
|`u2` |int |Integer
|`u4` |long |Long
|`u8` |long |Long
|`s1` |byte |Byte
|`s2` |short |Short
|`s4` |int |Integer
|`s8` |long |Long
|`str`, `strz` |String |String
|================================================

=== String encoding

Encoding a stream of bytes into a `String` is done with the standard
Java API:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#String(byte%5B%5D,%20java.nio.charset.Charset)[String
method constructor]

== Array types

All repetitions in Java are translated to `ArrayList<~>`
