= Kaitai Struct: Python notes

## Requirements

[[enums|enum description]] implementation in Python requires a enum support as described in [PEP-0435]. This support is available out of the box in standard libraries since Python v3.4, or since v2.4 using [[enum34]] PyPi compatibility layer.

* On Debian / Ubuntu, this library can be installed with `sudo apt-get install python-enum34`
* Otherwise, one can use just `sudo pip install enum34`

[PEP-0435]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0435/
[enum34]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum34
