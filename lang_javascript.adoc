== Approximate 64-bit integers

Current JavaScript specification lacks direct access to anything like
int64 type. Instead, accessing long integers would automatically
represent them internally as double-precision IEEE754 floats, potentially
losing least significant bits. It should be ok for smaller integers (up
to 56 significant bits), but note that JavaScript would use approximate
values for everything beyond that.
